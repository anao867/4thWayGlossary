        text: `<p>Q: Is vanity an essential of false personality?</p>
<p>A: It is one of the features of false personality in one or another sense. In some people it may be the chief feature, and then it is very obvious and visible, but very often these features are behind other things and do not show themselves.</p>`

        text: `<p>False personality is a complex formation, consisting of many elements, and it is not the same in different people. It is always changing, and it is never the same for two consecutive moments in the same person. It is very difficult to give a definition of false personality which would be true for all cases. But one thing is certain, that false personality is always something separate from oneself.</p>`

        text: `<p>Q: Is it only by separation that one can work on identification?</p>
<p>A: Only. Without realizing the difference between 'I' and false personality all efforts only strengthen the weaker side. As I said, this separation is the basis of all work on oneself. Unless this idea is understood, nothing can be attained, in everything one must start from that. This is the real difference between people in the work and not in the work. People who are not in the work think that they are what they are. People in the work already understand that they are not what they seem to be. This separation must pass through many phases, but it must begin.</p>`

        text: `<p>All the rest is 'Ouspensky' or 'false personality'. 'Ouspensky' is our imaginary picture of ourselves, because we put into it all that we think of ourselves, which is generally imaginary. All study comes down to the study of this imaginary picture and to separating ourselves from it. So at present you can call 'I' your valuation of the system. This is 'you'. From your attitude to the system, work in the system, interest in the system, 'I' can grow. On this basis you can separate 'I' from false personality. There is no guarantee that it will be absolutely right, but this method has a great practical value. False personality is always against the work for self-development and spoils the work of all other personalities. It can never be useful.</p>`

      {
        text: `<p>Q. What is the difference between real personalities and false personality?</p>
<p>A. You mix two divisions which are quite different and on a different scale, so they cannot be compared. Personalities (in the plural) spoken of in relation to essence, for I said that personality can be divided into different personalities which compose it. The division into essence and personality is at present merely theoretical and is only useful as a principle, for it is difficult to see it in oneself. We do not know our personalities, so we begin to study from two ends. We study first that personality which is connected with the work and which has developed from the magnetic centre; and then we study false personality, on quite a different scale. False personality is opposed to 'you', it is your wrong idea of yourself exactly what you are not. This division is practical, for it is necessary to know definitely what your false personality looks like. So you must not confuse false personality with personalities, because, although they are not very real, personalities may be based on real inclinations, real tastes and likes, whereas false personality is all false and may even pretend to like something that 'you' dislike or to dislike something 'you' really like. When you speak about false personality, you take 'you' as existing and false personality as not; when you speak about personalities, you leave false personality out of the conversation and discuss different divisions of what you consider to be 'yourself'. False personality must not become just a word. Everybody who speaks about it must have some picture of himself in the power of false personality. Only if this term is used like that can it give some result.</p>`
      },
      {
        text: `<p>Q. Could you say more about what 'I' is?</p>
<p>A. 'I' is only presumed; we do not know what 'I' is. But 'Ouspensky' I know and I can study him in all his manifestations. So I must begin with 'Ouspensky'. 'I' is elusive and very small; it exists only as a potentiality; if it does not grow, false personality will continue to control everything. Many people make the mistake of thinking that they know which is which. They say 'this is I', when in reality it is false personality. This is generally connected with our capacity to play roles. It is a very limited capacity; we generally have about five or six roles, whether we observe it or not. We may notice a certain, quite misleading, similarity between these roles and then, consciously or unconsciously, come to the conclusion that behind them there stands a permanent individuality. We call it 'I' and think that it is behind all manifestations, when in reality it is an imaginary picture of ourselves. This picture has to be studied. It is impossible to have a practical knowledge of oneself if one does not know one's false personality. As long as we think we are one, all our definitions are wrong. Only when a man knows that all his intentions, desires and so on are not real, that they are false personality, only then can he get something. This is the only practical work possible, and it is very difficult. False personality has to disappear, or at least be rendered powerless to hinder our work. But it will defend itself and will not give in easily. Work is struggle with false personality which will fight back, chiefly through lying, for lying is its strongest weapon.</p>`

      {
        text: `<p>Q: It seems to me that false personality is the only thing that can adapt to some new circumstance, it can play a new role and make it more comfortable.</p>
<p>A. False personality does not really adapt. To adapt in the ordinary sense means, more or less, a controlled action. False personality reacts in a different way, according to what it is, but it cannot adapt. And it does not necessarily make things more comfortable - you cannot rely on it. You must understand that you have not the slightest control of false personality. When we begin to see it we realize that it controls everything and nothing can control it. So you cannot call it adaptation. You must separate in yourself what you can control and what you cannot control. What you cannot control belongs to false personality, and what you can control belongs to you.</p>
<p>Q. How can one deal with the conceit of false personality?</p>
<p>A. You must know all its features first and then you must think rightly.<em> When you think rightly you will find ways to deal with it. You must not justify it; it lives on justification, and even glorification, of all its features. At any moment of our life, even in quiet moments, we are always justifying it, considering it legitimate and finding all possible excuses for it. This is what I call wrong thinking.</em> In studying false personality we begin to see mechanicalness more and more. Parallel with the realization of our mechanicalness we study how to get out of it by means of creating something that is not mechanical. How can we do it? First we must think about what we want, separate the important from the unimportant. Work on oneself, desire to know oneself and the ideas of the work, struggle to create consciousness, are not mechanical that we can be sure of. And if we look from this point of view we will see many imaginary things in ourselves. These imaginary things are false personality: imaginary emotions, imaginary interests, imaginary ideas about ourselves. False personality is utterly mechanical, so it is again the division into conscious and mechanical. This mechanical part of us is chiefly based on imagination, on wrong views of everything, and above all on a wrong view of ourselves. We must realize how much we are in the power of this false personality and invented things which have no real existence, and we must separate what we can really depend on from what is not dependable in ourselves. That may serve as the beginning. When we know ourselves better, this will help us to awake.</p>
<p>Q. Do you mean we must study our false personality by collecting material, observations?</p>
<p>A. By dividing yourself, by not saying 'I' to everything. You can really use the word 'I' only in relation to the more conscious part of yourself: desire to work, desire to understand, realization of not understanding, realization of mechanicalness; that you can call 'I'. 'I' starts growing only in connection with study, with work on oneself; otherwise it cannot grow and there is no change. A permanent 'I' does not come all at once. All illusory 'I's disappear little by little and real 'I' gradually grows stronger and stronger, chiefly through self-remembering. Self-remembering in the sense of just awareness is very good, but little by little when you go on it becomes connected with other interests, with what you want to get. At present, one moment you remember it, and then for a day or a week you forget it; but it is necessary to remember it all the time.</p>`
      },
      {
        text: `<p>Q. Is the object of self-remembering the gradual discovery of permanent 'I'?</p>
<p>A. Not the discovery; it is preparing the ground for it. Permanent 'I' is not there. It must grow, but it cannot grow when it is all covered with negative emotions, identification and other such things. So you begin by preparing the ground for it. But first of all, as I said before, it is necessary to understand what self-remembering is, why it is better to self-remember, what effect it will produce, and so on. It needs thinking about. Besides, in trying to self-remember it is necessary to keep the connection with all the other ideas of the system. If one takes one thing and omits another thing for instance, if one seriously works on self-remembering without knowing about the idea of the division of'I's, so that one takes oneself as one (as a unity) from the beginning then self-remembering will give wrong results and may even make development impossible. There are schools, for instance, or systems which, although they do not formulate it in this way, are actually based on false personality and on struggle against conscience. Such work must certainly produce wrong results. At first it will create a certain kind of strength, but it will make the development of higher consciousness an impossibility. False personality either destroys or distorts memory.Self-remembering is a thing that must be based on right function. At the same time as working on it you must work on the weakening of false personality. Several lines of work are suggested and explained from the beginning, and all must go together. You cannot just do one thing and not another. All are necessary for creating this right combination, but first must come the understanding of the struggle with false personality. Suppose one tries to remember oneself and does not wish to make efforts against false personality. Then all its features will come into play, saying, 'I dislike these people', 'I do not want this', 'I do not want that', and so on. Then it will not be work but quite the opposite. As I said, if one tries to work in this wrong way it may make one stronger than one was before, but in such a case the stronger one becomes, the less is the possibility of development. Fixing before development that is the danger.</p>

<p> Q. Is that something that one should be on guard against?</p>
<p>A. Certainly. Only a little part of you wants to self-remember, and other personalities, or 'I's, do not want it at all. It is necessary to find them and expose them, to see which are useful for this work, which are indifferent and which are so asleep that they do not know anything about it. The aim is to have control over one's 'I's, or personalities, to be able to bring one or another up, to arrange them in a certain way. The 'I' that has control will not be one of these you have now. This idea of the formation of real 'I' is most important; it cannot be formed accidentally. In most cases we are satisfied with a philosophical idea of'I'; we believe that we have it and do not realize that actually we pass from one 'I' to another.</p>
 <p>Q. In considering likes and dislikes, how can one separate what is real and what is false personality?</p>
<p>A. Start by realizing that it is all false personality, and then try to find out what is not. You cannot do the second before the first. First you must understand that all is false personality, and when you become<convinced of that, you may find what is 'yourself'. Go on observing. Work begins from the moment one realizes that one is not. When it enters into everything, when it becomes a realization, then it is productive work. But when one thinks of oneself as 'I' (the whole), then it is not productive work. You must understand that false personality is a very elusive thing. It is one, it does not consist of different personalities; but at the same time it contains contradictory and incompatible features, features that cannot manifest themselves at the same time. So it does not mean that you can see the whole of your false personality at one moment. Sometimes you can see more of it, at other times certain features of it manifest
 themselves separately. Also it must be remembered that false personality is often rather attractive or amusing, particularly for other people who live in their false personalities. So when you begin to lose your false personality, when you begin to struggle with it, people will not like you. They will tell you that you have become dull.</p>

 <p>Q. How can one tell what is not false personality?</p> 
 <p>A. One thing false personality cannot do is make efforts. This is the easiest way to know, if you are in doubt. False personality always tries to make everything as easy as possible, always chooses what requires least effort. But you must understand that you cannot learn anything or change anything without effort. So when you find an 'I' or a group of 'I's which are ready to make efforts, it means that they do not belong to false personality.<p>
 
<p>Q. Can one acquire a new false personality with regard to the system?</p>
 <p>A. If one does not think about or understand false personality and if one deceives oneself, thinking that one works, one will not acquirea new false personality, but false personality will grow. So it must be kept out, if not destroyed, soon after the beginning.</p>

<p>Q. My idea of myself often makes me think I am not properly valued and therefore I suffer because of my picture of myself.</p>

<p> A. Quite right, but do not think about the picture; you must only remember the direction. You may be mistaken in your ideas about yourself, but it is not important. Only, the direction must be right; you cannot go somewhere without knowing where you are going. You can see your imaginary picture of yourself only from the right point, and the right point is the direction. There is no other point from which you can see it.</p>

<p>Q. Could you say again what takes the place of real 'I' at present?</p>
<p>A. Desire to know. From this, real 'I' will grow, if it does. In the beginning it is difficult to define, it is the aim. If you connect yourself with a certain work, with a certain system, it begins to grow; but it cannot grow by itself, merely through happy circumstances. It is quite simple to establish that we have no permanent 'I'. Try to remember yourself for fifteen minutes; this will show the degree of your being. If you had a permanent 'I', you would be able to remember yourself for fifteen hours. It is all very simple, really, only we have no keys to our machine. If we had the keys, it would be easy to open it and see what is inside, and then separate the imaginary from the real. But even that we have to learn: we are too used to the unreal. So the subject of our study must be false personality, which is always there. Only if you know it in all its manifestations can you separate what is 'I'. We are identified with our imaginary picture of ourselves and it is a very dangerous form of identification.</p>

<p>Q. How can one begin to distinguish what is real?</p>
<p>A. You cannot. But you can distinguish what is unreal, just in the same way as you distinguish truth and lying. There is no need of philosophy; take it simply. We must first apply discrimination to simple things. Imagination plays a very important part in our life, because we believe in it. The real can grow only at the expense of the imaginary. But in ordinary life the unreal grows at the expense of the real.</p>

<p>Q. I do not quite understand the division between work and ordinary life.</p>
<p> A. The relation of personal work to life is precisely this relation of permanent 'I' to false personality. Work is permanent 'I' in the essence, and ordinary life is false personality. When you understand what permanent 'I' is, when you are conscious of yourself and have permanent control, this is work. At present you live in false personality.</p>

 <p>Q. I find it difficult to see the difference between 'I' and 'Miss B.'.</p>
<p>A. As I have just said, in the division of 'I' and 'Miss B' practically all is 'Miss B'. 'You' can outgrow 'Miss B' only from your interest in the system, because real'I' cannot grow from anything else. All the material that is there will never come to anything without these ideas, without this interest, because it keeps it on a certain line, in a certain direction. At first you study, observe yourself and so on, then, after some time,
 if you work, 'I' will appear for a second from time to time, but you will not be able to keep it and it will disappear again. This will go on for some time, and then, at a certain moment, it will appear and stay long enough for you to recognize and remember it. This is the way of all new things; at first they come for very short moments, then they stay longer. It is the natural way of growth, it cannot be otherwise. We have in us too many momentums of mechanical habits of thinking and too many otherwrong things. Real'I' appears and is immediately squashed. When you understand more about false personality you will realize that you are surrounded by it. You cannot see anything without the eyes of false personality, you cannot hear without the ears of false personality or speak without the voice of false personality. Everything goes through false personality, and the first step is to know it, because then you will know how much of your life it occupies.</p>

<p> Q. Since false personality is imaginary, does it really exist?</p>
<p>A. It does not really exist, but we imagine it exists. It exists in its manifestations, but not as a real part of ourselves. It is a combination of 'I's that have no real foundation, but they act and produce certain effects. Do not try to define it, or you will lose your way in words, and we must deal with facts. Negative emotions exist, yet at the same time they do not exist, since there is no real centre for them. It is the same with false personality. It is one of the misfortunes of our state that we are full of non-existent things. You must understand that you cannot even begin to work on the level you are; you have to change certain things first. You can find what to change only as a result of
 your observations. Sometimes it becomes very clear, and only then does the fight begin, because false personality begins to defend itself. You must know false personality first. All that we speak about now, refers to the first stage understanding that we do not know false personality, that in order to know it we must study, that all the work we do is done at the expense of false personality, that all the work we can do on ourselves means diminishing the power of false personality, and that if we begin to try and work, leaving false personality without disturbing it, all the work will come to nothing. I repeat again you must understand that false personality is a combination of all lies. features and 'I's that can never be useful in any sense, either in life or in the work just like negative emotions. Yet false personality always says 'I' and always ascribes to itself many capacities, such as will, self-consciousness and so on, and if it is not checked it remains an obstacleto all the work. So one of the first and most important factors, in trying to change oneself, is this division of oneself into 'I' and whatever your name may be. If this division is not made, if one forgets it and continues to think of oneself in the usual way, or if one divides oneself in a wrong way, work stops. Work on oneself can only progress on the basis of this division, but it must be the right division. It often happens that people make a wrong division: what they like in themselves they call 'I' and what they dislike, or what in their opinion is weak or unimportant, they call false personality. This is quite a wrong division; it changes nothing and one remains as one was. This wrong division is simply lying, lying to oneself, which is worse than anything, because the moment one meets with the smallest difficulty it will show itsel fby inner arguing and wrong understanding. If one uses a wrong division, it will not be reliable and will fail one in a moment of need. To make a right division of oneself one must understand what is 'I' and what is 'Ouspensky', 'Brown' or 'Jones', in other words, what is lying and what is oneself. As I said, even if you admit this possibility of dividing yourself, you are bound to call what you like in yourself 'I' and what you dislike 'Not I', for the right division cannot be found at once; you must find some indications in connection with the work which will help. For instance, if you say that your aim is to be free, it is first of all necessary to understand that you are not free. If you understand to what extent you are not free and if you formulate your desire to be free, you will then see in yourself which part of you wants to be free and which part does not. This would be a beginning.</p>

<p>Q. Can one see false personality without help?</p>
<p> A. There is nothing against it theoretically, only I never saw such a case. Even with help, people will not see it. You can show a man a mirror, and he will say, 'This is not me, it is an artificial mirror, not a real mirror. It is not a reflection of me.'</p>

<p>Q. How can one eliminate false personality?</p>
<p>A. You cannot eliminate it. It is just the same as trying to cut your head off. But you can make it less insistent, less permanent. If your false personality is there for twenty three hours out of the twenty-four, when work begins it will be there only twenty-two hours and 'you' will be present an hour longer. If, at a certain moment, you feel the danger of a manifestation of false personality and you find a way to stop it, this is what you have to begin with. The question of elimination does not enter at all it is connected with quite different things. You must have control.</p>

<p>Q. Isn't the study of false personality analysing oneself? I thought it was a bad thing?</p>
<p> A. To a certain extent it is analysing. What was said about refraining from analysis was in the first lecture. I said then that analysis was impossible because you do not know enough. Analysis means establishing causes and effects. So at first I said that you have to abstain from analysis and just observe, observe, observe, nothing more, because the time for analysis would come when you knew the laws. Now we are studying these laws, so certainly you have to analyse more and more. You see, rules for observation and thinking in the first lecture are one thing, but with the passing of time they change and modify. What one cannot do in the first month one already must do in the second month. Both difficulties and possibilities increase all the time. Analysis must be used carefully, when it is necessary, not for everything. Sometimes it is only a waste of time.</p>

<p>Q. Would you say that false personality is sometimes built up by other people for instance, when people say in front of a child that they hate strangers?</p>
<p> A. Quite right. False personality is built up from many sides, and certainly to a great extent by suggestions from other people.
 A child gets many suggestions, especially about his likes and dislikes.</p>
 <p>Q. I don't quite follow how to find the 'I's that object to the work. Does it mean we should sift out what the 'I's are?</p>
<p> A. You must not think theoretically about it. Try to find what in you objects to the ideas of the system, or try to find the 'I's (or you can call them anything you like)which are indifferent to it. Suppose you have certain definite tastes in food. These 'I's which are interested in food cannot be interested in self-remembering. Then there are other 'I's interested in things opposed to self-remembering. There are many things you can do with pleasure only if you do not remember yourself, and naturally these 'I's will be very inimical to self-remembering, becauseit will only spoil their pleasure. Try to find them in that way. Theoretical approaches will not help.</p>
<p> Q. What is the origin of these artificial groups of 'I's?</p>
<p> A. They may be formed by imitation, desire to be original, to be attractive, to be
 admired by people and so on.</p>

<p> Q. When you find a group of 'I's which do not want to self-remember, what do you do about it?</p>
 <p>A. Leave it alone. If it does not want to, what can you do with it? If there are groups of 'I's that want to, work on them. Those'I's which realize the necessity to self-remember must work with other 'I's that also want to. They must not spend their time in persuading other 'I's.</p>

<p> Q. Is it to be expected that some'I's in a man would be frightened of the idea of separating 'I' from 'Mr. A'?</p>
<p> A. Certainly all 'I's which constitute false personality will be frightened, because it is death to them. But you must understand that they may show their fear only for sometime and, after that, they may disguise themselves in order not to die. You may seriously think that you have finished with false personality, whereas it is only concealing itself inside some feature, ready to appear. This feature is always weakness. So long as it remains it takes all energy, but it may be very well disguised, and in that form it may even become stronger, growing parallel with the growth of real 'I'. So the realization of the necessity of this division into 'I' and 'Mr. A' is not sufficient to destroy it. You must remember that false personality defends itself.</p>

<p> Q. Is false personality based on negative emotions?</p>
<p> A. There are many other things in false personality besides negative emotions. For instance, there are always bad mental habits; false personality, or parts of false personality are always based on wrong thinking. Although to a certain extent you are right: in some cases if you take negative emotions away from false personality it collapses, for it cannot live without them. On the other hand, some false personalities can function on most pleasant emotions. There are very cheerful false personalities and in this way your false personality can deceive you and make you believe that you are struggling with negative emotions. It can deceive you in many different ways.</p>

 <p>Q. Do all negative emotions spring from false personality?</p>
<p> A. How could it be other wise? It is, so to speak, a special organ for negative emotions, for displaying, enjoying and producing them. You remember that there is no real centre for negative emotions. False personality acts as a centre fo them.</p>

<p> Q. Is identification always a manifestation of false personality?</p>
<p> A. False personality cannot manifest itself without identification, the same as negative emotions and many other things in us, such as all lying, all imagination. One identifies, first of all, with one's imaginary idea of oneself. One says 'this is I' when it is nothing but imagination. It is the same with lying - one cannot lie without identification; it would be very poor lying and nobody would believe it. So it means that first one must deceive oneself, and then one can deceive other people. Study of false personality is one of the quickest methods for self-remembering. The more you understand your false personality, the more you will remember yourself. What prevents self-remembering is, first of all, false personality. It cannot and does not wish to remember itself, and it does not wish to let any other personality remember. It tries in every possible way to stop self-remembering, takes some form of sleep and calls it self-remembering. Then it is quite happy. You must not trust your false personality its ideas, its words, its actions. You cannot destroy it, but you can make it passive for some time and then, little by little, you can make it weaker.</p>
 <p>Q. You say one must not trust anything connected with false personality, but it seems to be all there is?</p>
 <p>A. It cannot be so. There is one thing - you, and there are imaginary 'I's. You is what really is, and you must learn to distinguish it. It maybe very small, very elementary, but you should be able to find something sufficiently definite and solid in yourself. If we are entirely false personality, then nothing happens. There are people who are only false personality. Other sides of them are so subdued, so weak, that they cannot resist false personality. These people will not study themselves because they would be afraid of seeing what they are. False personality does not like it at all. Generally, if they begin, they very soon leave off, explain it in someway, for they are unable to continue
 self-study. But if one has the energy to go on studying false personality, this shows that one has something besides it. As I said before, this work is every day, not once a month or once a year. It is an examination every day.</p>

<p> Q. Would you say false personality is more inclined to leave you as you grow older?</p>
<p> A. No. If you do nothing against it, it grows. Tastes may change, but it grows. This is the only 'development' that happens in mechanical life. False personality is the most mechanical part of us so mechanical that there is no hope for it. So it must not be allowed to enter into the work.</p>

<p> Q. Presumably really great people, the saints for instance, conquer false personality?</p>
<p>A. It depends on the degree. Saints describe the devils they have to struggle with. All devils live in false personality.</p>

<p> Q. How can I remember my realization that much of emotional suffering is in false personality?</p>
<p>A. Only by self-remembering. Suffering is the best possible help for self-remembering if you learn how to use it. By itself it does not help; one can sufferone's whole life and it will not give a grain of result, but if one learns to use suffering, it will become helpful. The moment you suffer, try to remember yourself.</p>

<p>Q. There are two kinds of suffering: one is due to seeing my own mechanicalness and weakness, and the other is suffering from seeing someone you are fond of ill or unhappy. How to work against it or use it for the work?</p>
<p> A. The question is, can you do something or not? If you can, you can, but if you cannot, it is another thing. If we begin suffering about everything we cannot help, then we shall certainly never cease suffering. The chief thing is to find how much imagination there is in it. We may be perfectly sure there is none, but if we make one more effort we often see that it is all imaginary. We have a wrong picture of ourselves, and at the same time we ascribe to this wrong picture real features. But if this picture is false, then everything about it is bound to be false, and its suffering is also false. It maybe very acute, but this does not make any difference. Imaginary suffering is generally more unpleasant than real, because with real suffering you can do something, but with imaginary suffering you can do nothing. You can only get rid of it, but if you are fond of it or proud of it, then you have to keep it.</p>

<p> Q. I still do not see how to start understanding false personality?</p>
<p> A. You must know what it is, place it, so to speak; this is the first step. You must realize that all identification, all considering, all lies, all lies to oneself, all weaknesses, all contradictions, whether seen or unseen, all these are false personality. It is like a special breed of dog. If you do not know it, you cannot speak about it. Even to see little bits of it is quite enough, for every small part of it is the same colour. If you see this dog once, you will always know it. It barks in a special way, walks in a special way.. . .In the beginning you cannot know which is 'I'and which is false personality. What you call 'I' is a complicated structure, and so is false personality. You cannot know everything about either of them; but if you take from one side something you have no doubt about that it is false and from the other side something you have no doubt about that it is true, you can compare them.</p>

<p> Q. Sometimes I observe myself identifying or considering and find that I do so because of a picture I have of myself. Can I in this way come to know false personality and, by observing it, weaken it?</p>
<p>A. Yes, it is the only way, but only if you do not get tired of it, because, in the beginning, many people start eagerly, but soon get tired and begin to use 'I' indiscriminately without asking themselves 'which I'? Our chief enemy is the word 'I', because, as I said, we have really no right to use it in ordinary conditions. Much later, after long work, we can begin to think of the group of 'I's that correspond to Deputy Steward as 'I'. But in ordinary conditions, when you say 'I don't like', you must ask yourself, 'Which of my "I"s does not like?' In this way you constantly remind yourself of this plurality. If you forget once, it will be easier to forget next time. There are many good beginnings in the work, and then, after some time, this is forgotten and people start to slide down, and in the end become more mechanical than before. The beginning of self-knowledge is understanding who speaks in you and whom you can trust.</p>

<p> Q. Does one's capacity forwork increase just as much as one is able to weaken false personality?</p>
<p> A. Work begins with struggle against false personality. Everything one can get one gets only at the expense of false personality. Later, when it is made passive, one may get much at the expense of other things, but for a long time one has to live, so to speak, off false personality. False personality is very difficult to find in ordinary life, because, since there is no action against it, there is also no resistance. But when a person begins to work, resistance to work appears, and this resistance is false personality.</p>

<p> Q. Cannot false personality be interested in, or attracted by, system ideas?</p>
<p> A. Yes, very much. Only then you will have the system in the light of false personality, and it will be quite a different system. The moment false personality takes the system to itself it only grows stronger and weakens the system for you. It adds one word here and another there, and you cannot imagine in what an extraordinary form some of the ideas come back to me. One word omitted from some formulation may make an idea quite different. False personality always knows better and is always fully justified in doing what it likes. This is where the danger lies. The system means all that is said, in the sense in which it is said. If one corrects it, consciously or unconsciously, then it cannot be called the system - it will be pseudo system, falsification of the system. The moment it becomes incorrect or something is forgotten or left out, it will give wrong results.</p>

<p> Q. I ask these questions because I sometimes doubt the genuineness of my interest in the work I may be lying to myself.</p>
<p> A. Only you can answer that; and there again only if you do not forget the fundamental principles and say 'I' about something which is only one of the'I's. You must get to know other 'I's and remember about them. To forget about this is very dangerous, because then a knock, a slight change in something can be enough to put everything wrong. Until now, when we spoke about man, we spoke about general human features common to all people. But at a certain moment in the work, besides understanding the general principles, one must try to find one's own peculiarities, for one cannot know oneself for practical purposes if one only knows the general characteristics. Each man has his own individual features, his own weaknesses when he is unable to resist things that happen. These features or weaknesses may be very simple or very complicated. One man may be able to resist everything except good food; another all except talk, or he may be lazy, or too active. It is very important at a certain stage of self-study to find one's chief feature, which means chief weakness. People's chief weaknesses are very different, and if we can resist something that another man cannot resist because it happens to be his chief feature, this difference in weaknesses gives us the illusion that we can 'do'. Chief feature or chief weakness is in false personality. In some cases it is possible to see definitely one, two or three features or tendencies, often linked together, which come into everything like an axis around which everything turns. This is chief feature. Sometimes it is very clear and apparent, but sometimes it is difficult to describe. Our language has often no words, no forms to describe it and it can only be indicated in a roundabout way. It is interesting that one can hardly ever find one's own chief feature, because one is in it, and if one is told, one usually does not believe it. But we can find what stands side by side with it, although it is not it. It is sometimes useful to collect opinions of friends about oneself,for this helps in discovering one's features. It is very important to find out what creates obstacles to our work. Until one has found it, a chief feature means constant loss of energy, so we must find this leak and stop it.</p>

<p> Q. Can one ever find the chief feature by oneself?</p>
<p> A. At a certain moment in organized work it will come out, or you may be told. But if you are told, you will not believe it. Or sometimes it is so obvious that it is impossible to deny it, but with the help of buffers one can forget it again. I have known people who gave a name to their chief feature and for some time remembered it, and then forgot. You must come near to it yourself. When you feel it yourself, you will know. If you are only told, you may easily forget. When you find many manifestations of your false personality, you may find your feature.</p>

<p> Q. Is it what you call a buffer?</p>
<p> A. No, but buffers hide the chief feature; it is helped by buffers.</p>
 <p>Q. If we find out our chief features, can we correct them? You said we cannot change anything.</p>
<p>A. In the ordinary way we cannot. But here it means using the result of experience and knowledge that does not belong to ordinary life.</p>

<p> Q.But an ordinary man changes too.</p>
<p> A. Of course he changes, he becomes more mechanical, more narrow, more set. There may be exceptions, but as a rule things do not progress in ordinary life. Personalities change, particularly if circumstances change, but it is mechanical, accidental change. We often base our opinion on exceptions, whether we observe them rightly or wrongly. Exceptions are easier to notice than rules.</p>

<p> Q. Having observed a certain tendency in oneself, one decides that it shall not happen.</p>
<p> A. Usually after one has decided it still goes on happening. Or if it does not happen, generally another tendency appears in its place. As a rule only one thing stops things - fear.</p>

<p> Q. Do chief features vary during life?</p>
<p> A. If they are clearly delineated, they go on throughout the whole life.</p>

<p> Q. Yet I can see things that I had that do not exist now.</p>
<p> A. Possibly. Our knowledge of ourselves is very defective. One can observe many things in life and make great mistakes, if one does not know how to verify. And generally, as I said, it is difficult to see chief feature.</p>

<p> Q. Could you tell me what my chief feature is?</p>
<p> A. I do not think so. You see, this is not necessary for starting to work. In the beginning, what is important is not the chief feature itself but what is produced by it, and that you can study in the form of attitudes. We do not know our attitudes because we have never thought about ourselves in the right way. We have too many imaginary ideas. What we must study now is all our points of view, habitual emotions, the way we think, what we invent. These are all results of chief feature or chief features, for there may be two or three features which are the most important, not necessarily only one. Think about false personality; this is quite sufficient for practical purposes. As a theory, false personality in most cases turns round one axle and that axle is chief feature. If a man has one big weakness, from one point of view it is an advantage, because if he can conquer this feature or weakness he can in one stride achieve many
 things. It is an advantage when things are concentrated, many things coming together at one point. Then efforts at this point produce better results than if one works at different points. But chief feature is not always definable. Sometimes you can put your finger on it, sometimes not; in one person you can see it, in another not. But false personality you can see.</p>

<p> Q. Is chief featurea food for false personality?</p>
<p> A. Chief feature is not food. It is false personality; it is something on which false
 personality is based and which enters into everything.</p>

<p> Q. Does chief feature always make decisions at important moments?</p>
<p> A. This is the best definition for it that it always makes decisions. In connection with chief feature, it is better to think first on general lines why you came to the system, what you want from the system. It often happens that people come to lectures for years and forget why they came. If you remember why you came, the system can answer your questions, but not without that. You may not remember about mechanicalness; you may forget about the very keen conviction in every person that he can 'do', and that if he cannot it is because he did not think about it or did not wish to. It is necessary to struggle with this idea, and understand that we are mechanical, that we can do nothing, that we are asleep, that we have many 'I's all these things. This will help you to see false personality, for all these things we ascribe to ourselves are standard examples of imagination. And imaginary personality, or false personality,
 is chief feature for everybody.</p>

<p> Q. Is false personality always selfish?</p>
<p> A. If you think of yourself as false personality and try to find what is not, you may be fairly sure that all that is selfish is false personality. But the more you think about it, the less you will see it. It may appear very unselfish, and that is the worst of all!</p>
 <p>Q. Are there many varieties of chief feature?</p>
 <p>A. There are strange varieties and there are classical ones. One very common feature, described in many places in the New Testament, is when we see other people's faults but not our own. Then certain kinds of self-pity are very common. And there are also curious combinations for which it is sometimes difficult to find a psychological definition.</p>

<p> Q. Is self-remembering the only way to defeat chief feature?</p>
<p> A. Without self-remembering we can do nothing. It is the only way.</p>

 <p>Q. Is it not possible to have different features when one is with different people?</p>
<p> A. No, these are roles. Features do not change so quickly.</p>

<p> Q. Is blaming other people a feature?</p>
<p> A. It may be a feature. But what is it based on? On lack of understanding. If you begin to study psychology, you find that all causes are in yourself; there can be no causes outside yourself. You do not remind yourself of this often
 enough. One little part understands that causes are in you, but the larger part continue to accuse other people. At the bottom of every favourite negative emotion you will find self-justification which feeds it. You must stop it in your mind first, and then after some time you will be able to stop it in the emotion too. Lack of understanding is the first cause, lack of effort the second.</p>

<p> Q. Did you say that laziness can be a chief feature?</p>
<p> A. Laziness is for some people three-quarters of their lives or more. Sometimes laziness is very important and is the chief feature of false personality, and then all the rest depends on laziness and serves laziness. But you must remember that there are different kinds of laziness. It is necessary to find these different kinds by observing yourself and observing other people. For instance, there are very busy people who are always doing something, and yet their mind may be lazy. This happens more often than anything else. Laziness is not only desire to sit and do nothing.</p>

<p> Q. What is the best way to struggle with false personality?</p>
<p> A. Always do something which false personality does not like and very soon you will find more things it does not like. If you continue, it will get more and more irritated and will show itself more and more clearly, so that soon there will be no question about it. But first your struggle must be based on knowing you must know its features, find what it particularly dislikes. One false personality dislikes one thing, another dislikes another thing. You must hav enough strength in yourself to go against it. Now let us speak about the relation of false personality to other parts of man. In every man, at every moment, his development proceeds by what maybe called a Static Triad. This triad can be called static because things at the apex of the triangle always stay in the same place and act as neutralizing force while the other forces change very slowly. Man is divided into four parts: body, soul, essence and personality. We have already spoken about essence and personality. The term 'soul' is used in the system in the sense of life-principle. The soul may be described as a cloud of fine matters or energies connected together and bound to the physical body. As long as it is in the body, the body is alive and body and soul make one thing. When they separate, we say that the body dies. It is this that distinguishes a piece of dead meat from living flesh. When a centre is working well, the soul is concentrated there. But in an ordinary man the soul has no psychic qualities, nor is it any use your knowing anything more about it. I only tell you this from a theoretical point of view; it is simply material, although of a finer
 materiality than the body. This diagram may be useful, because it shows what we are, if we can see it. It shows the changes in our development, what we are now and what we can become. When you learn to use this diagram, it will help you to determine definite stages in the work. The first triangle shows the state of man in ordinary life; the second shows his state when he begins to develop. There are long periods between the state shown in the first and the state shown in the second triangle and still longer between them and the third triangle. Actually there are many intermediate stages, but these three are sufficient to show the way of development in relation to false personality. It is necessary to remember that none of these states is permanent. Any of them may last for half an hour and then another state may come, then again a different state. The diagram only shows bow development goes. It would be possible to continue the diagram beyond permanent 'I', because permanent 'I' again has many forms.</p>`,
